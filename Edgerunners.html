                        <div class="details" hidden>
                            <p>The streets are meaner than ever, filled with new drugs, gangs, and weapons that make an M-16 look like a toy. As a city cop, you're heavily armed and armored, but often still outgunned by cyber-enhanced gangs and corporate mercenaries. Your patrols take you through the toughest neighborhoods, where each night is a firefight waiting to happen. If you're a Corporate Cop, you have access to heavy weapons, combat armor, and high-tech backup, but only patrol the clean, safe sectors. The most dangerous detail is the PsychoSquad, hunting down cyberpsychos with monstrous guns and advanced gear, but that job drives many detectives to the edge of sanity.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Authority</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Authority represents your ability to intimidate or control others through your position as a lawman. This skill allows you to call on the forces of the Law and Government to get what you want. It includes the ability to question suspects, make arrests, and defend innocents. Authority is only effective if you appear confident; hesitation can lead to failure. The higher your Authority, the more effectively you can face down criminals, particularly high-level mobsters and officials. Authority is applied to your Cool stat.</p>

As a junior executive, you're on the fast track, climbing the corporate ladder amidst a cutthroat environment filled with sabotage, bribery, and blackmail. Your survival depends on navigating corporate politics and securing your position while managing high-stakes projects that range from productivity schedules to black ops missions. The pressure is immense, and ethics are often compromised. Every decision you make could be the difference between rising to power or being eliminated.</p>

                        <h3>Netrunner</h3>
                        <div class="details" hidden>
                            <p>From a young age, Netrunners have been prodigies in the digital world. By fifth grade, they were already hacking school mainframes, and by thirteen, they had financed their first neural interface plugs through illicit means. With a direct mental link to computers, Netrunners dive into the Net, the worldwide telecommunications system. They are elite hackers, seamlessly slipping into the toughest mainframe systems. Their defense and offense programs are ready at the mental touch, capable of toppling data fortresses from major corporations like EBM, ITI, and SonyMatsushita-Ford. While uncovering corporate treachery or deadly secrets is part of the job, Netrunners live for the thrill of the next big hack. They know the risks—advanced counter-intrusion programs and smart AIs—but they thrive on the edge, headfirst in the Net.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Interface</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Reflects the Netrunner's ability to manipulate Interface programs. This skill is used for various Menu functions such as locating Remotes, running software, controlling Remotes, downlinking, loading, creating, and deleting programs. Interface is based on the INT Stat.</p>
                            <h3>Bonuses:</h3>

                                <li><strong>Program Difficulty:</strong> The difficulty level of any program created cannot exceed the combined total of the Netrunner’s INT, LUCK, and Programming skills.</li>

                        <h3>Nomad</h3>
                        <div class="details" hidden>
                            <p>Ten years ago, corporations drove your family off the farm, and you joined a growing group of homeless families to form a Nomad pack. Now, your pack—comprised of nearly two hundred members—roams the freeways in a fleet of cars, vans, buses, and RVs. This mobile town on wheels has teachers, MedTechs, leaders, and mechanics, all related by marriage or kinship. You seek supplies, odd jobs, and spare parts in a fragmented society. Sometimes you trade labor for food or cash, while less lawful packs hire out as muscle in corporate wars. Your vehicles are armored and armed, every kid knows how to use a rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Life as a Nomad is tough, but you thrive in this world.</p>
                            <p>The most visible Nomads are Scouts—leather-armored riders on bikes or fast muscle cars who protect the convoy and find safe campsites. As a Scout, you navigate through trouble, whether it's rival packs, law enforcement, or corporate enforcers. Like a modern-day cowboy, you ride the hard trail with your gun and bike, embodying the Nomad spirit.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Family</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Allows Nomads to call upon the resources and help of their extended tribal family, including weapons, cash, information, or even a small army. The higher your Family ability, the more important you are within the pack and the more support you can summon.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Level +2:</em> Several pack members to assist with tasks like wrecking a town.</li>

                            <p>Rockerboys are the street poets, rebels, and social consciences of the 2000s. Armed with digital porta-studios and garage laser disk mastering, they spread their messages far and wide, from record stores to comsats. Often, their messages challenge the powers that be—Corporations and Governments alike. With roots tracing back to legends like Dylan, Springsteen, and The Who, Rockerboys use their music to inspire, inform, and lead. Whether through protest songs or electrifying rock n' roll, they rally people to action, exposing corruption and toppling regimes. A Rockerboy’s power lies in their ability to galvanize the masses, transforming gigs into movements.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Charismatic Leadership</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Allows the Rockerboy to sway crowds. The number of people influenced equals the Rocker's level squared times 200, added to their Cool stat.</p>
                            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> This skill can incite crowds to take significant actions, such as rioting or attacking fortified positions. The higher the Charismatic Leadership level, the larger and more complex the actions a crowd can be persuaded to undertake.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Level +3:</em> Incite a nightclub crowd to become rowdy.</li>
                                <li><em>Level +5-6:</em> Provoke a concert crowd of thousands to trash a nearby neighbourhood.</li>

                            <p>Solos are elite fighting machines of the Cyberpunk world, whether working as freelance mercenaries or Corporate cybersoldiers. Most Solos have military backgrounds, serving in Corporate armies or Government "police actions." Over time, they rely more on cyberware—cyberlimbs for weapons and armor, bio-program chips for enhanced reflexes and awareness, and combat drugs for an edge in battle. The best Solos might become ronin, offering their lethal skills to the highest bidder. However, this life comes with a heavy price: a body more machine than flesh, killing reflexes that are hard to control, severe addictions, and a pervasive distrust of others. The price is steep, but for a Solo, it’s worth it.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Combat Sense</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Enhances the Solo's ability to perceive danger, notice traps, and avoid harm. Combat Sense provides a bonus to both Awareness skill and Initiative equal to the Solo's level in Combat Sense.</p>

                        <div class="details" hidden>
                            <p>Techies are the tinkerers and fixers of the Cyberpunk world, always ready to disassemble and reassemble anything that crosses their path. With screwdrivers and wrenches always at hand, they can solve any technical problem—whether it's a downed computer, a malfunctioning hydrogen burner, or a glitchy interface plug. Their skills are essential in a world where few understand how technology truly works. While fixing everyday items pays the bills, real money comes from big jobs: illegal weapons, stolen cybertech, corporate espionage gear, and gadgets like thermite bombs and hunter-killer robots. Successful Techies reinvest their earnings into new gadgets and hardware, always looking for innovative applications. However, their black market work also earns them enemies, necessitating strong defense systems and occasionally calling in favors from Solos.</p>
                            <h3>Skill: Jury Rig</h3>
                            <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Allows the Techie to temporarily repair or alter anything for 1D6 turns per level squared. This repair is not permanent and will break down after the elapsed time.</p>
