                <h2>The World of Malifaux</h2>
                <p>Malifaux, eh? Where do I even begin? Imagine a world where everything’s out to kill ya, rob ya, or worse—and that’s just the people. It’s a place of opportunity, they say, but don’t mistake that for easy livin’. On one side, you’ve got the Guild—big, bad, and in charge. They control the flow of soulstones, the lifeblood of this world and the one back on Earth. Problem is, they’re about as friendly as a rattler in your boot.</p>
                <p>Then there’s the Resurrectionists—necromancers who’d sooner have a chat with your corpse than you yourself. Never a good time when they’re around. Oh, and the Arcanists, who fancy themselves revolutionaries or freedom fighters, but they’re really just spell-slingin’ troublemakers with a penchant for explosions. And don’t get me started on the Neverborn—those creatures? They ain’t natural, and they don’t belong anywhere near decent folk. But Malifaux? It’s their backyard, and they don’t take kindly to visitors.</p>
                <p>Course, there’s also the Outcasts—people like me, who don’t quite fit in with any of the big players. We’re a scrappy bunch, ekin’ out a livin’ however we can. Some take up bounty huntin’, some run cons, and others—well, they do worse.</p>
                <p>Still, it ain’t all bad. Malifaux’s got opportunity, if you’re willin’ to get your hands dirty. Soulstones, magic, wealth—there’s fortunes to be made if you’ve got the guts and a bit of luck. Just don’t turn your back for too long, or Malifaux’ll swallow you whole. Welcome to the city where nightmares are real, and survival ain’t a guarantee. You’ll love it, or it’ll kill ya. Maybe both.</p>

                <h2>Tales and Stories</h2>
                <p>Now, I ain’t sayin’ I’ve lived the most honest life, but honest lives don’t make good stories, do they? Name’s Jeremiah—snake oil salesman, teller of tales, and the occasional savior of souls. I’ve traveled the Breach sellin’ miracles in a bottle, some of which might even work. But if you’re expectin’ me to be some noble hero, you’ve got the wrong man.</p>
                <p>See, the stories I tell ain’t the kind where the righteous triumph and the wicked fall. No, mine are tales of gamblers, grifters, monsters, and madness. Of shootouts and soulstones, of folk who’ll stab you as quick as shake your hand. And if you think that’s all made up, well, stick around—you’ll hear some things that’ll make you question what’s real and what ain’t.</p>
                <p>So pull up a chair, pour yourself a drink, and let me spin you a yarn. Just be warned—truth and fiction don’t stay separate long in the Breach. They tangle together like snakes in a barrel. Now, where should I begin…?</p>
