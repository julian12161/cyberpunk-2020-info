                    <h3>International Electric Corporation</h3>
                    <p>IEC is in a rather unique position in that, while it has few allies in the true sense of the word, its relationships with most other large corporations, are at least cordial. This is because IEC supplies critical components which most other corporations need for the manufacture of at least some of their products.</p>

                    <p>Emile Lazarus wanted to continue being a soldier, but not for the flailing U.S. goverment.</p>
                    <p>Nelson Katzadoulos' dream was to create a mercenary organisation that could offer a variety of high quality services to the discriminating customer who wanted a little more for his money.</p>
                    <p>With an honored war hero as military coordinator, and a wealthy inheritor as silent partner, the lazarus group was born.</p>

                    <h3>Militech</h3>
                    <p>Militech continues to be a dominating force in military hardware manufactoring. Under the leadership of the capable General Donald Lundee (retired), and the technically brilliant Antonio Lucessi (who not only still designs, but supervises the recruitment of a new generation of talented young designers and engineers), Militech continues to flourish and grow.</p>
