                    <h3>Arasaka</h3>
                    <p>When most people think of Arasaka the picture in their minds is that of the black-clad guards employed by so many corporations, businesses and powerful individuals throughout the world</p>

                    <h3>International Electric Corporation</h3>
                    <p>IEC is in a rather unique position in that, while it has few allies in the true sense of the word, its relationships with most other large corporations, are at least cordial. This is because IEC supplies critical components which most other corporations need for the manufacture of at least some of their products.</p>

                    <h3>Lazarus</h3>
                    <p>Emile Lazarus wanted to continue being a soldier, but not for the flailing U.S. goverment.</p>
                    <p>Nelson Katzadoulos' dream was to create a mercenary organisation that could offer a variety of high quality services to the discriminating customer who wanted a little more for his money.</p>
                    <p>With an honored war hero as military coordinator, and a wealthy inheritor as silent partner, the lazarus group was born.</p>

                    <h3>Militech</h3>
                    <p>Militech continues to be a dominating force in military hardware manufactoring. Under the leadership of the capable General Donald Lundee (retired), and the technically brilliant Antonio Lucessi (who not only still designs, but supervises the recruitment of a new generation of talented young designers and engineers), Militech continues to flourish and grow.</p>

                    <h3>Petrochem</h3>
                    <p>Petrochem's bread and butter is CHOOH2, the synthetic alcohol that has become the world's standard combustible fuel; they are responsible for 60% of the world supplies.</p>
                    <p>The corporation remains on the cutting edge of chemistry and materials research and production. And by virtue of owning a huge fraction of the world's arable land, it is also among the world's largest agricultural concerns.</p>
                    <p>From the outside, the company appears stable. Within, things are not so rosy. Tension between the camps of Trenton Parker and Ellen Trieste is becoming critical. Both sides prepare for a struggle that could tear the company apart. It remains to be seen how long the company can stay secure as world (and internal) tensions rise.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Soviet World Oil Industries</h3>
                    <p>In 1997, the Soviets had the capability to recover only a fraction of their oil reserves; the largest in the world. After a massive program of expansion and modernisation, Kerosov, the Soviet state oil industry, was strong enough to break away from the union government's central comittee. By 2002, it had become the Soviet <em>World</em> Oil Industries: SovOil.</p>
                    <p>SovOil's leaders know, however, that the oil won't flow forever, and are making plans to carry the Corp into the 2050's, when oil is no longer a prime source of income.</p>
                    <p>In the new Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, SovOil is a major economic force, and its expansion into other industries is not unnoticed by Petrochem. Much ill-feeling remains, even 10 years after the war; with competition heating up, and resources growing scarcer, the two giants may be headed for another confrontation.</p>
