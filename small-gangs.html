                    <p>While the major gangs dominate the headlines and strike fear into the hearts of Night City's residents, it's the smaller gangs that often slip under the radar—and that makes them just as dangerous. These groups may lack the numbers or resources of the bigger players, but their unpredictability and local influence can pose serious threats to specific districts, businesses, and individuals. Whether they're up-and-coming outfits looking to carve out territory or niche gangs with specialized crimes, they’re a part of the city’s chaotic pulse. Residents are advised to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity related to these lesser-known groups.</p>
