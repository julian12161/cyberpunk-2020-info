                    <p>While the major gangs dominate the headlines and strike fear into the hearts of Night City's residents, it's the smaller gangs that often slip under the radar—and that makes them just as dangerous. These groups may lack the numbers or resources of the bigger players, but their unpredictability and local influence can pose serious threats to specific districts, businesses, and individuals. Whether they're up-and-coming outfits looking to carve out territory or niche gangs with specialized crimes, they’re a part of the city’s chaotic pulse. Residents are advised to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity related to these lesser-known groups.</p>

When someone joins the Personalities,the person he will be biosculpted into is picked randomly; if you get Lana Turner, you're Lana, if you get Abraham Lincoln, be ready to wear stovepipe hats. Your rank in the gang depends on how well you adjust to your role. These people are the ultimate posers; once dropped into their roles, they live the life. All members can be recognized by the fine steel neck band they wear.</p>
