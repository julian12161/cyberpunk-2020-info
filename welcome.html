                <h3>About your DataTerm</h3>
                <p>A dataTerm is a public information access module and computer. Placed in heavily armoured cases on most U.S. city street corners, they are linked by fibreoptic landlines to centrally located computer databases.
                    DataTerms provide news, information, weather reports, entertainment news, net cyberaccess ports and computer terminal use (by the minute). They are the corner market of the future, serving information (rather than produce), to the busy world of the Street.
