Their lack of strategic coordination keeps them from being the most dangerous gang in Night City, but individual members are highly lethal. Hostile towards Sacred Blades, Back Alley Brawlers, and Inquisitors. Notably avoids conflict with Arasaka security forces. Engage with extreme caution.</li>

While not as overtly violent as other gangs, they are territorial and quick to retaliate when crossed. Known to avoid unnecessary conflicts but can be a formidable force if provoked.

                                        <li><strong>NCPD Advisary:</strong> The D.J.’s are a non-violent chromer gang, more focused on chasing fame than causing trouble. While their forgeries and ticket scams are a nuisance, they pose little threat beyond minor fraud. Easily manipulated with flattery, they are a decent source of intel on the Night City rock scene but unreliable when it comes to delivering on their promises.</li>

Known for targeting the Inquisitors but will not hesitate to escalate conflicts with corps, solos, or civilians when it suits their needs.

Known for discipline and martial arts proficiency, they prioritize subdual over lethal force but can escalate if provoked. Businesses often prefer their protection over corporate security, fostering a level of trust within the community. Though generally peaceful, they are not to be underestimated in combat. Engage only if necessary, and avoid entanglement in illicit activities, as the Silver Slash maintains a strict code of fairness and will retaliate if crossed.</li>

High-profile individuals have occasionally collaborated with them, blurring the line between harmless fun and criminal mischief. Their ongoing feud with street mimes (and by extension, the Julliard gang) often leads to public altercations. Approach with caution.</li>

                                        <li><strong>NCPD Advisary:</strong> Performers typically travel in pairs, carrying hidden weapons like weighted juggling clubs and machineguns concealed in viola cases. Their turf in the Corporate Center is well-defended, offering safety for their preferred audiences but posing a danger to any unauthorized performers. Visitors are advised to enjoy the performances from a safe distance and avoid interfering with Julliard members. Even if you’re just passing through, it’s wise to steer clear of any altercations involving street performers in this area.</li>

They often engages in a dangerous ritual called "counting coup," where members leave red handprints on rivals or even law enforcement to signify dominance. The Sacred Blades frequently use hallucinogenic drugs, making them unpredictable and highly dangerous in confrontations. Citizens are advised to avoid any individuals displaying red handprints or aggressive behavior and to report any gang activity immediately.</li>

                                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Members are grotesquely biosculpted to resemble circus clowns with colorful hair, bulbous red noses, and permanently grafted white facial "makeup" forming exaggerated frowns.

                                <li><strong>Insignia:</strong> A frowning clown face paired with the slogan "Let's have some fun!"</li>
                                <li><strong>NCPD Advisary:</strong> The Bozos are no longer a mere prankster gang but a citywide menace bordering on mass psychosis. Since the rise of their leader, the Great Bozo, in 2019, they’ve escalated from slapstick pranks to psychological torture and lethal ambushes. Any interaction with the Bozos should be treated as a potential life-threatening situation. Officers are advised to maintain distance and never engage alone. Immediate evacuation of civilians and coordinated tactical responses are recommended when Bozos are spotted.</li>

                                <li><strong>NCPD Advisary:</strong> Originally infiltrating the student population through drug deals, the gang has escalated to ritualistic murders, torture, and psychological terror tactics. Victims are often dismembered with machetes, and body parts are displayed in public areas as warnings. Some targets may receive forewarning through disturbing symbols, such as chicken blood and feathers on their doorstep, but more frequently, attacks are random and without provocation. The gang’s influence is strongest on Grace Street, where they control businesses through extortion and fear. Civilians are advised to avoid Grace Street, and any signs of Voodoo Boy activity should be reported immediately.</li>
