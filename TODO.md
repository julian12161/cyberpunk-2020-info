# 🧠 Cyberpunk Dataterm TODO List

This file outlines planned features, future enhancements, and potential ideas for the Dataterm project. Contributions welcome.

---

## ✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY (COMPLETE)
- [x] Working NPC Manager with initiative, damage, logging
- [x] Contact calculator with cost formulas
- [x] Page structure with CRT-style load effect
- [x] Mobile support and adjusted navigation
- [x] General Messages page with dynamic layout
- [x] Secret GM section with password protection

---

## 🔧 NEXT UP

- [ ] Add hardcopy export for messages (to PDF or print) // Maybe but really intended for theme only
- [ ] Add delete confirmation for NPC cards
- [ ] Add background noise to Message Mail input (typewriter, CRT hum) // Maybe

---

## 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL / IDEAS

- [ ] Calculator toggle on NPC Manager
- [ ] Add “encounter mode” to track Characters in active initiative order
- [ ] Combat log auto-scrolls or collapses old turns
- [x] Support for exporting / importing NPCs via JSON
- [ ] Ability to save/load player-submitted messages (mock Netwatch review inbox)
- [ ] GM notifications for expiring messages (48-hour rule)
- [ ] Optional dice roll history in NPC Manager
- [ ] Sound effect for CRT bootup / page open (muted by default)

---

## 🌐 SITE STRUCTURE + EXPERIENCE

- [ ] Consider "admin" subdomain or hidden route for GM tools
- [ ] Create a proper 404 “Data Fragment Missing” page
- [ ] Add favicon (retro CRT green square or blinking cursor)
- [ ] Style Netwatch alerts (when password is wrong)

---

## 🧰 FUTURE GM TOOLS

- [ ] Player profiles / logins (even if just localStorage)
- [x] Timeline tracker or mission logbook
- [ ] Cyberware inventory / usage tracker (basic list + notes)
- [ ] Netwatch simulation terminal (lore + rule hints)
- [ ] Dataterm admin panel (CRUD messages, view logs)
- [ ] Mini random event generator (“Daily Datapulse”)

---

## 🖼 VISUAL / IMMERSION POLISH

- [ ] CRT scanline overlay toggle (pure CSS or canvas) // Maybe
- [ ] Make NPC Manager feel more like a Netwatch deck
- [ ] Add flickering “LOADING…” animation during page loads // Maybe
- [ ] Consider weather or broadcast messages on homepage
