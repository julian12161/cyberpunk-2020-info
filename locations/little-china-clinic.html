                        <h3>Little China Clinic</h3>
                        <p>From the street, Jade Blossom Health looks like a rough-around-the-edges charity clinic—one of those places that treats the uninsured, undocumented, or untraceable. Its flickering red cross neon sign barely holds a charge, and the painted windows are sun-faded and peeling. A paper sign on the door says “Walk-ins Welcome – No Questions Asked.”
                            <br />
                        Inside, the waiting room is dim and oppressively quiet. The cracked linoleum floor sticks slightly with every step, and the overhead lights buzz like angry hornets. A handful of mismatched plastic chairs line the walls—some bolted down, some cracked, all uncomfortable. The air smells faintly of antiseptic, sweat, and something metallic beneath it. A busted vending machine hums in the corner, stocked with expired protein bars and Stims.
                            <br />
                        A lone receptionist—too calm, too clean for the rest of the place—sits behind a scratched plexiglass screen, tapping on an old terminal like it’s for show. She greets you with a dead smile and eyes that don’t quite match her tone. A printed price list taped to the glass offers suspiciously cheap cyberware installations and unusual tech.
                            <br />
                        Security is low-key but unmistakable—two guys in street leathers with bulges under their coats, one leaning against a “Do Not Enter” door chewing synth-gum like it’s his job.</p>
                        <p>The click of the latch echoes too loudly as the “Staff Only” door creaks open, releasing a blast of frigid air laced with the coppery tang of old blood and ozone. The lighting here is harsher—white fluorescents buzz erratically overhead, casting long, stuttering shadows across tiles once white, now slicked with rust-colored grime and black smears where boots have dragged something heavy.
                            <br />
                        To the left, the narrow corridor branches into a row of surgical rooms—if you can call them that. The first has clamps still wet, tools laid out haphazardly on a steel tray, and red footprints leading back toward the drain in the floor. The stench of antiseptic can’t mask the underlying rot.
                            <br />
                        The farthest room is the worst: an amputated body, pale and slick with cold sweat, lies breathing shallowly on the operating table. Arms missing, legs truncated. Tubes trail from the body to the wall, where biomonitor displays beep infrequently.
                            <br />
                        To the right, a half-raised shutter leads into the loading dock, where the stink of refrigerated metal and machine oil thickens. Plastic crates lie stacked on rusting carts, their sides stained with drips of oil, blood, and coolant. Some are cracked open—inside, cyberarms wrapped in foil, a spinal rig, or worse: half a face, the ports still active.
                            <br />
                        In the far corner, a pair of pulsing cold units emit a low, unsettling hum, their pressure valves hissing at intervals like exhaling lungs. The frosted glass doors bulge slightly, as though the contents are pressing back—hungry to be seen.</p>
